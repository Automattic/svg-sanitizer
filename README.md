# svg-sanitizer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/coverage)

This is my attempt at building a decent SVG sanitizer in PHP. The work is laregely borrowed from [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify).

I will update this when something is actually working. For now, hang tight.
